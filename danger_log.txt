We added the function for drivers to confirm ride. But we did not deal with time
conflix, which means the driver may confirm diffrent rides at the same time

01/28
Added role sharer. We did not process the condition that many sharers requsted
the same ride, which may add to a large passenger number.

01/29
We added functions to edit ride information. But we could not distinguish 
between owner and sharer.

01/30
Fixed the problem in the previous day, finished email confirmation for 
ride owner and sharer. But we did not implement the funciton to validate the
email address. This can be improved in the future.
